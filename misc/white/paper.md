## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 NFTs and their Impact
Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have introduced new use cases in various aspects of our lives. They have disrupted industries such as art and games, and now they have the potential to revolutionize e-commerce. NFTs enable creators and producers to directly sell their merchandise to buyers, either independently or through marketplaces.

### 1.2 Disruption in Art, Games, and E-commerce
NFTs offer creators the opportunity to sell their work more easily and profitably. Previously stagnant industries, such as the press, journalism, and writing, can find revolutionary business models through NFTs. This whitepaper will explore these use cases in detail.

### 1.3 Revolutionary Business Models
Kredeum NFTs aims to provide web2 contributors with a new way to sell their goods, eliminating intermediaries. The technology behind Kredeum NFTs enables instant sales of various creations, including web pages, blog articles, virtual goods, subscriptions, and services.

### 2.1 The Decentralized Marketplace
Kredeum NFTs envisions creating a decentralized marketplace where individuals can sell their creations without intermediaries. The platform aims to empower creators and provide them with full control over their sales and distribution process.

### 2.2 Empowering Web2 Contributors
Led by a team of experienced entrepreneurs and developers from the web2 space, Kredeum aims to bridge the gap between web2 and web3. By leveraging the expertise of the team, Kredeum NFTs plans to integrate with popular platforms like WordPress, representing 45% of the current web, and expand to other CMSs like PrestaShop and Drupal in the future.

### 2.3 Integrating with WordPress and Beyond
Kredeum NFTs will be available as a WordPress plugin, allowing users to archive their media library on decentralized storage and mint NFTs directly from their WordPress media library. Additionally, Kredeum NFTs will offer a Dapp (NFT wallet) and a smart contract library with innovative features such as AutoMarket and MultiChain NFT support. The technology will also be accessible as a Chrome extension, enabling the transformation of any image or web page into an NFT.

### 2.4 Advanced Technology and Innovative Selling Model
Kredeum NFTs stands out by combining advanced technology with an innovative selling model. The platform enables "searchers" to crawl the web, find valuable goods, and connect with creators to facilitate the sales process. This decentralized approach mirrors the services offered by centralized marketplaces like OpenSea or SuperRare but in a fully decentralized manner.

## 3. Business Model

### 3.1 Roles in Kredeum NFTs Ecosystem
Every Kredeum NFT is associated with three roles: creator, minter, and owner. These roles can be held by different individuals or the same person. The creator is the original producer of the content, the minter is responsible for minting the NFT, and the owner represents the current or historical list of all owners.

### 3.2 Selling Model
Kredeum NFTs enables creators to sell their NFTs directly to buyers without intermediaries. The platform encourages the development of a community of "searchers" who find valuable goods and connect creators with potential buyers. This decentralized selling model aims to empower creators and provide them with more control over their sales.

### 3.3 Decentralization and Community Participation
Kredeum NFTs emphasizes decentralization and community participation. By leveraging blockchain technology, the platform ensures transparency, immutability, and security for NFT transactions. Furthermore, the community's involvement in minting and curating NFTs contributes to the growth and sustainability of the ecosystem.

## 4. Use Cases

### 4.1 Photographers
Photographers can leverage Kredeum NFTs to monetize their work directly, reaching a global audience without the need for traditional intermediaries. By minting their photos as NFTs, photographers can establish ownership, prove authenticity, and sell their creations to collectors, enthusiasts, or individuals interested in digital art.

### 4.2 Bloggers and Writers
Kredeum NFTs offers a revolutionary business model for bloggers and writers. They can mint their blog articles, news posts, or even entire publications as NFTs, providing a unique and monetizable ownership experience for their readers. This new approach to publishing allows writers to directly profit from their content and potentially disrupt traditional media business models.

## 5. Kredeum NFT Factory

### 5.1 Open Source Development
Kredeum NFT Factory is an open-source project financed through grants provided by various protocols and entities such as Swarm, TheGraph, Polygon, and Gitcoin. The project's goal is to create a fully decentralized platform that enables anyone to create and sell NFTs. The open-source nature of Kredeum NFT Factory promotes transparency, collaboration, and community-driven innovation.

### 5.2 Funding and Grants
Kredeum NFT Factory relies on grants from the blockchain community to fund its development. These grants support the ongoing research, engineering, and improvement of the platform, ensuring its scalability, security, and accessibility.

### 5.3 Kredeum Company's Role
Kredeum, as a software company in the blockchain space, is responsible for developing the Kredeum NFT Factory and associated technologies. The company does not engage in NFT trading or investment activities. Its primary focus is to build and maintain the infrastructure necessary for a decentralized NFT ecosystem.

## 6. Conclusion

Kredeum NFTs aims to revolutionize e-commerce by empowering creators and eliminating intermediaries through its decentralized marketplace. By leveraging advanced technology, integrating with popular platforms like WordPress, and embracing an innovative selling model, Kredeum NFTs provides a unique opportunity for creators to monetize their work directly. With its open-source approach and funding through grants, Kredeum NFT Factory strives to create a sustainable and community-driven ecosystem for the future of NFTs.
